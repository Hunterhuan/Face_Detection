## Download the dataset

```
python Dataset_download.py
```

Then ,it will download the dataset from the website, and unzip them into the folder.



## Extract the feature

```
python extract_feature.py
```

it will generate the hog feature and picture file for using after.

## Logistic Regression

```
python logistic_regression.py
```

It will trainning the logistic regression, and save this model.

## Fisher model

```
python fisher_model.py
```

It will trainning the fisher model, and save this model.

## svm model

```
python svm.py
```

It will trainning the svmmodel, and save this model.

## CNN model

```
python keras_conv.py
```

It will trainning the CNN model, and save this model. To run this, you must install keras based on tensorflow. 

## Face detection

```
python face_detection.py
```

It will show the performance of face detection on img_590.jpg.

## CNN feature Visualize

```
python visualize_cnn_feature.py
```

It will show the pca and tsne result for feature extract from the CNN model.

## Hog feature Visualize

```
python visualize_hog_feature.py
```

It will show the pca and tsne result for hog feature.
